# NotifApp
Notif App is a simple Android application built to demonstrate basic Android development skills.  
The app features a single button that, when pressed, starts a **10-second timer**.  
A progress bar updates every second (in 10% increments), and a numeric value (10, 20, 30...100) appears above it.  

Once the progress reaches 100% (after 10 seconds), the app sends a **notification** with a title, message, and icon.  

### 🎯 Key Features
- Timer implementation using **Kotlin Coroutines**  
- Custom **progress bar** animation  
- Sending **Notifications**  
- Requesting **Notification Permission** from the user  
- Built with **Jetpack Compose** and **Material Design 3**

### 🧩 Purpose
Notif App is a practice project created to test and demonstrate:
- Timer logic in Android  
- Coroutine usage  
- Working with Notification channels and permissions
